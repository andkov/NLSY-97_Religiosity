### Installation is important
Instructions for installing the pieces required for generating and running our reports. 
https://github.com/OuhscCcanMiechvEvaluation/MReporting/blob/master/DocumentationGlobal/ResourcesInstallation.md

### Official Documentation
Most of these links are from the primary developer, and are focused on a specific part of our workflow. 
https://github.com/OuhscCcanMiechvEvaluation/MReporting/blob/master/DocumentationGlobal/ResourcesOfficial.md

### Opinions
Theis collection of articles, blogs, and unofficial documentation should help provide context for what we're trying to do with our workflow.

### Security Issues
As David says, no matter how cool and efficient our reporting system is, it won't matter if it introduces a security hole.  Make sure that this public GitHub repository does NOT contain any PHI dataset, or a password/token to the MySQL or REDCap server.  As we design and run reports, let's continue to add items to this checklist:

### Project Health & History
The repository's website describes the progress from a few perspectives.  The [issue tracker](https://github.com/OuhscCcanMiechvEvaluation/MReporting/issues?state=open) manages the tasks assigned to different collaborators, and lists the associated milestones.  Also, the project's [wiki](https://github.com/OuhscCcanMiechvEvaluation/MReporting/wiki/Home-page-of-MReporting-wiki) links to a list of reports, and to the REDCap change log.
